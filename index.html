    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Pocket Landlord is very convenient. The house owner or the landlord registers for the app and is given
        administrative rights. The landlord then inputs details of all their tenants. The tenants then get
        notifications on their emails to accept the invite and they all receive unique codes (IDs). From there the
        tenants can be able to see thir payment history, their payment modes and they get notifications when the rent is
        due.
        Once they pay thier rent they get an electronic receipt through their emails.</p>

    <h2>Set up requirements</h2>

        <li>A smart phone or laptop</li>
        <li>Reliable internet connection</li>
